The first LMA algorithm does multi-layered curve-fitting of the DTOF for determining the absolute optical properties (and/or the thicknesses of layers).

The second LMA algorithm uses the changes in moments to determine the changes in optical properties (and/or the thicknesses of layers).

The data includes 3 experiments involving blood and 2 experiments involving ink, in a two-layered phantom, measured with a multi-wavelength TD-NIRS system.
