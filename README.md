DOI  : 

Data : 3 experiments involving blood and 2 experiments involving ink, in a two-layered phantom, measured with a multi-wavelength TD-NIRS system.

- First LMA algorithm does multi-layered curve-fitting of the DTOF for determining the absolute optical properties (and/or the thicknesses of layers).

- Second LMA algorithm uses the changes in moments to determine the changes in optical properties.

If you use the code (or the data) or find it helpful, please cite:
