Data and MATLAB scripts used for publication "Two-layered blood-lipid phantom and method to determine absorption and oxygenation employing changes in moments of DTOFs"

DOI  : 

Data : 3 experiments involving blood and 2 experiments involving ink, two-layered phantom measured with a multi-wavelength TD-NIRS system.

Codes: First LMA algorithm does multi-layered curve-fitting of the DTOF for determining the absolute optical properties (and/or the thicknesses of layers).
       Second LMA algorithm uses the changes in moments to determine the changes in optical properties.
