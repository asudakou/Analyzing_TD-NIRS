"Two-layered blood-lipid phantom and method to determine absorption and oxygenation employing changes in moments of DTOFs"

DOI  : 

The first LMA algorithm does multi-layered curve-fitting of the DTOF for determining the absolute optical properties (and/or the thicknesses of layers)

The second LMA algorithm uses the changes in moments to determine the changes in optical properties.
